I'm a former mechanical engineer now dabbling in data science. I'm interning with a water district in Southern California. When I am not engaged in wrestling their enterprise system database for glory and data, I can be found helping others find actionable insight in the data they have. I'm not 100% sure what I want to do with this blog just yet, but I will probably be using it to document my work on various projects. We'll see how that turns out.
